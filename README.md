 ### To-Do List

- [ ] ➢	Provide accessible information about products to customers in the same location as the grocery store who are cut off by distance of other constrains but need to shop or window shop. Sellers only advertise to customers in their location.
- [ ] ➢	To minimize the difficulty of business owners from finding customers and reducing the cost of advertisement which are paid to most radio and television stations who genuinely allocate smallest of their broadcast time to such broadcast.
- [ ] ➢	Eliminate the unwanted patrol of window shoppers who take up space in various shops and markets. This goes a long way to reduce human traffic in our markets.
